# Geeetech-i3-B-pro-configs

This repository contains a collection of Marlin configurations and associated objects required. I have supplied basic pictures to show what the setup looks like.

I have provided the Marlin code, my changed config files and 3rd party objects as a courtesy. I do not claim any rights over the Marlin code or 3rd party objects as provided. If I have created or modified an object (i.e. remix) I will attempt to clearly identify these objects and consider them licensed (where permissible) as Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
